# ppasupat-resume

I am not sure why I am doing this. I should have used LaTeX but I guess it's too late. Oh well ...

To generate PDF with the default font (Linux Biolinum; sans-serif), run

    ./run.sh

To use Linux Libertine (serif), run

    ./run.sh liber
    
Other fonts are also possible, but they currently break the layout.

# Requirements

* [unoconv](http://dag.wiee.rs/home-made/unoconv/)
* `bash`, `sed`, and `zip`
* A nice font such as one of the [Linux Libertine fonts](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/)
